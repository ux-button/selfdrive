## To Do

1. Replace all get requests with file or folder ID. Don't use path
   from the browser to find file or folder in DB

2. Replace file names in storage with fileIDs to safely store them
   in storage without a chance to crack with brootforced requiest

3. Fix reseting to root folder after every reload
